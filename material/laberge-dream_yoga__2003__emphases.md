LaBerge (1980) serendipitously discovered that spinning one’s dream
body when the dream begins to fade causes a return of stability to the
dream state. Presumably, this sensory engagement with the dream discour-
ages the brain from changing state from dreaming to waking. Research
(LaBerge 1993) has proven the effectiveness of spinning: the odds in favor of
continuing the lucid dream were about 22 to 1 after spinning, 13 to 1 after
hand rubbing (another technique designed to prevent awakening), and 1 to
2 after “going with the flow” (a control task).
